Major alliances included the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy).\\n\\n4. **Declaration of War:**\\n   - When Serbia's response did not fully satisfy Austria-Hungary, they declared war on July 28, 1914. This triggered a chain reaction:\\n     - Russia, allied with Serbia, began to mobilize against Austria-Hungary.\\n     - Germany, allied with Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia.\\n     - Germany also declared war on Russia's ally, France, and invaded Belgium to reach France, violating Belgian neutrality.\\n     - This violation prompted Britain to declare war on Germany.\\n\\n5. **Nationalism, Militarism, and Imperialism:**\\n   - Nationalistic fervor, militaristic cultures, and competition for empires among European powers had created an environment ripe for conflict. These long-term causes helped fan the flames.\\n\\nThe escalation of these events, set within a web of alliances and national interests, propelled the world into a large-scale war that lasted until 1918.\""
